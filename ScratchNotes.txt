Reference-modify functions for properties and features called from the user files

File with structs of all descriptor structs
File with structs attempting to reconstruct the input rate data (vertex and instance)
    -- instance marked with *_instance

File with classes similar to GPDescriptorSets.h, where each controls a descriptor set layout, and a main class holds them all
    ++ write functionality

 As defined by a config cpp file
    -- Material classes
    -- two tiered - base --> impl with descriptors marked out -> impl with storage (or lack of) for backing buffers and images
    Parameters:
        -- Mark descriptors by name as special attention
        -- Specify special attention for whole shader (COMPUTE vs GRAPHICS)
        -- Specify stages and file/names for each stage
